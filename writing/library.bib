	abstract = {Across multiple species of social mammals, evidence is accumulating that sociality is associated with fitness. In long-lived species, like primates, lifespan is one of the main fitness components. A growing number of studies shows that interactions with individuals of both sexes, and both weak and strong bonds predict survival. We used 18 years of data from the Lomas Barbudal Monkey project to quantify sociality in 11 capuchin (Cebus capucinus) groups and tested whether females{\textquoteright} tendencies to interact with their group members are associated with survival. We found that females who provide more grooming to other group members survive longer. The association is stronger for older females. These benefits were independent of females{\textquoteright} rank, presence of their adult daughters and mothers, and their group size. Receiving more grooming from others showed a similar effect on survival, but confidence in the estimated effect was unclear. Participation in coalitionary aggression and foraging in close proximity of others were not predictive of increased survival. The results presented here suggest that females{\textquoteright} general propensities to affiliate with members of their group may result in survival-related benefits. Females might enjoy these benefits through exchanging grooming for other currencies, such as coalitionary support or tolerance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
